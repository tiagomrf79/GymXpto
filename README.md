## Goals
Learn practices and concepts, by implementing:
- Clean arquitecure
- ASP.NET Core Web App
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Common frameworks, like Moq or Entity Framework
- Blazor Server App
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Azure cloud

Eventually use the API and core developed to introduce new projects like .NET Maui, React and Angular.

## Achievements
- Implemented sucessfully CQRS (Command Query Responsability Segregation), which was a new concept for me.
- The API controllers are clean and simple, and at the same time returning what I need so far using command response objects.

## To do
- Complete tests by following guidelines from article, book or course.
  - Learn more about how testing should be done in each different type of test (units tests, integration tests, etc.)
  - Figure out all the things that should be tested in each layer of a clean architecture application
  - Figure out a way to get all testing data from the same place, whether for in memory context or repository mock (JSON file?)
- Expand the current work done in Application, Api and Tests to the remaining entities
  - Implement GetPagedResponseAsync in Api and Persistence.Tests
  - CRUD operations in remaining entities
- Implement identity functionality...
- Implement logging and exception handling...
- Develop the Blazor UI...
- Use Docker...
- Use Kubernetes...
- Publish to the Azure cloud...
